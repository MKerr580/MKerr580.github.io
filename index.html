<h2> In West Philadelphia I was born and raised </h2>
		<p>
			On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
			Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin all cool,  And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. 
			When a couple of guys who were up to no good,  Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood.
			I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,  
			And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bel Air." 
			I whistled for a cab, and when it came near,  
			The license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.  
			If anything I could say that this cab was rare,  
			But I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air." 
			I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,  
			and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homes, smell ya later."  
			Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,  To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
